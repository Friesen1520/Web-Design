          <div id="desc">A video game or computer game is an electronic game that 
            involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, 
            controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. 
            This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, 
            touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games have just as much diversity as board games, and they can be used by yourself as well as with friends. </div>
